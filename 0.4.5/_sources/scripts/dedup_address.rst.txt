Dedup Addresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dedup addresses reflect BlockSci's understanding that various distinct address types actually require a common piece of information to spend them. Pay to pubkey, pay to pubkeyhash and pay to witness pubkey hash all require knowledge of a given pubkey in order to be spent. Similarly pay to scripthash and pay to witness scripthash both require knowledge of a given spending script.

While the `Address` type views these as distinct addresses, the `DedupAddress` type views them as the same. The API's of the two classes are highly similar, but differ in what outputs they consider as sent to them and thus for example, may display difference balances.
