BlockSci Documentation
=====================
Documentation_ is available for the python interface library

.. _Documentation: https://citp.github.io/BlockSci/

Additionally, a demonstration Notebook_ is available in the Notebooks folder

.. _Notebook: https://citp.github.io/BlockSci/demo.html

More detailed documentation is coming soon. Meanwhile, feel free to contact us at blocksci@lists.cs.princeton.edu.

Quick Setup using Amazon EC2
==============

If you want to start using BlockSci immediately, we have made available an EC2 image: ami-1f9b8364_. We recomend using instance with 61GB of memory or more for optimal performance (r4.2xlarge). On boot, a Jupyter Notebook running BlockSci will launch immediately. To access the notebook, you must set up port forwarding to your computer. Inserting the name of your private key file and the domain of your ec2 instance into the following command will make the Notebook available on your machine.

.. code-block:: bash

	ssh -i .ssh/your_private_key.pem -L 8888:localhost:8888 ubuntu@your_url.amazonaws.com

This sets up an SSH tunnel between port 8888 on your remote EC2 instance and port 8888 on your localhost. You can use whichever port you like on your local machine. Next, you can navigate to https://localhost:8888/ in your browser and log in with the password 'blocksci'. A demo notebook will be available for you to run and you can begin exploring the blockchain.

Local Setup
=====================
To run BlockSci locally, you must be running a full node (such as bitcoind or an altcoin node) since BlockSci requires the full serialized blockchain data structure which full nodes produce. 

Parser
----------

The next step is parsing the blockchain downloaded by the full node. The blockchain_parser binary which is built from this repo performs the transformation of this blockchain data into our customized BlockSci database format. It has two modes.

Disk mode is optimized for parsing Bitcoin's data files. It reads blockchain data directly from disk in a rapid manner. However this means that it does not work on many other blockchains which have different serialization formats than Bitcoin.

..  code-block:: bash

	blocksci_parser --bitcoin-directory .bitcoin --output-directory bitcoin-data

RPC mode uses the RPC interface of a cryptocurrency to extract data regarding the blockchain. It works with a variety of cryptocurrencies which have the same general model as Bitcoin, but with minor changes to the serialization format which break the parser in disk mode. One example of this is Namecoin.

..  code-block:: bash

	blocksci_parser --username [user] --password [pass] --address [ip] --port [port] --output-directory bitcoin-data

Using the Analysis Library
============================

After the parser has been run, the analysis library is ready for use. This can again be used through two different interfaces

C++
------

In order to use the C++ library, you must compile your code against the BlockSci dynamic library and add its headers to your include path. The Blockchain can then be constructed given the path to the output of the parser.

.. code-block:: c++

	#include <blocksci/chain/blockchain.hpp>
	
	int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    		blocksci::Blockchain chain{"file_path_to_output-directory"};
	}

Python
-------

To use the python library, you only need to import the BlockSci library. By default the library is installed into BlockSci/Notebooks. To use the library simply open the Python interpreter in that folder and run:

.. code-block:: python

	import blocksci
	chain = blocksci.Blockchain("file_path_to_output-directory")

BlockSci Compilation Instructions
======================================

Here are the steps for compiling BlockSci on Ubuntu 16.04.

..  code-block:: bash

	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev libboost-all-dev libsqlite3-dev autogen \
	autoconf libleveldb-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev libjsonrpccpp-dev libjsonrpccpp-tools \
	python3-dev python3-pip
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt install gcc-6 g++-6
	sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-6 60 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-6

	git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1
	cd secp256k1
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --enable-module-recovery
	make
	sudo make install
	
	git clone https://github.com/citp/BlockSci.git

BlockSci was created by Harry Kalodner, Steven Goldfeder, Alishah Chator, Malte MÃ¶ser, and Arvind Narayanan at Princeton University. It is supported by NSF grants CNS-1421689 and CNS-1651938 and an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship under grant number DGE-1148900. We've released a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02489) describing BlockSci's design and a few applications that illustrate its capabilities.
